#1
The first player combines two or more of their letters to form a word and places it on the board to read either across or down with one letter on the center square. 
Diagonal words are not allowed.

#2
Complete your turn by pressing the end turn button. The game will automatically fill your rack as long as there are enough tiles left in the bag.

#3
New words may be formed by:
- Adding one or more letters to a word or letters already on the board.
- Placing a word at right angles to a word already on the board.
- The new word must use one of the letters already on the board or must add a letter to it.
- Placing a complete word parallel to a word already played so that adjacent letters also form complete words.

#4
No tile may be shifted or replaced after it has been played and scored.

#5
You may use a turn to exchange all, some, or none of the letters.
To do this, press the swap button, then select which letters you want to exchange. This ends your turn.

#6
The game ends when all letters have been drawn and one player uses their last letter; or when all possible plays have been made(no one has made a move for 7 turns).
