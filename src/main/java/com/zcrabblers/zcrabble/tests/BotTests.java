    // - Test that the bot uses the correct number of tiles from rack
    // - Test that all the tiles in a play came are the same ones that are missing in rack
    // - test that the bot can take a new turn with the same rack if a play is rejected
    // - No tests for optimal play for now
    // - more tests probably. the most important thing is that the board played and the rack is always correct.
